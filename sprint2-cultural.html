<h2>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
<p>
    I would like to start my programming career with a job in web development. The opportunity to work remotely is very attractive with my 
    current lifestyle and would give me some extra time to work on my current relationships with friends/family etc. Long time, 
    I would like to find my way into A.I development if the life leads me that way. 
</p>

<h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
<p>
    More self-confidence in social situations, especially in groups. I often find myself trying to overcompensate by making bad jokes or not 
    reading the atmosphere properly because I lack some confidence in being who I am. I know EDA will give me lots of opportunity to work 
    with my fellow cohorters and give me the support I need to overcome this weakness. 
</p>

<h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h2>
<p>
    One of my strengths is that I am willing to cooperate quite quickly and get stuck into the work without much prompting. I don’t 
    like wasting time when there is work to be done (but I love taking a break as much as the next person!). A limitation that I often find 
    myself getting into is that I am not confident in my work when others will be involved. I will often question “is this good enough? Could 
    this be better? How could it be better?” and I’d get too nervous to share. 
</p>

<h2>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h2>
<p>
    Time management is an important factor that I consider when committing myself to work. However, I don’t confuse this will the common 
    standards of “I will code x amount of time a day” because I truly believe in working smart not hard. When there is work that needs to
     be completed, I will set myself a timeframe of getting it day by a specific day. This helps frame the workload that I have and how 
     smart I can work to fit it in comfortably. I think it will come in handy when working with others so that we can manage deadlines 
     together and not have to pressure each other as much. 
</p>

<h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way. </h2>
<p>
    I’m coming into EDA as a beginner in a lot of code and I know that others in the cohort have more experience and knowledge than I do. As 
    I described above, I like to set a timeframe around my workload so I don’t need to feel as pressured for a deadline and so I will try my 
    best to work a problem out but if I know that I am stuck and it is pushing the timeframe then I will ask for help right away.
