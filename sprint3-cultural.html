                <h2> What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
                <p>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is about ones level of mindfulness to self-knowledge and self-mastery and attention to others feelings. EQ builds on having positive mental habits in day to day life and when negative emotions are introduced. </p>
                <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
                <p>IQ is measured on technical/mechanical knowledge (how much you know). EQ is on the other end of the spectrum and looks at how much do you know about yourself, how you feel and how you react to situations that you face. It is also about how well you are able to pay attention to othersâ€™ emotions, being mindful and a conscious listener.</p>
                <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
                <p>EQ is important for pretty much everything whether it is at home, school or work. Developing a higher EQ allows us to pay attention to how we communicate with ourselves and with other people. This lets us build stronger and deeper relationships with other people and especially to your own being. EQ is also important for employability. The workplace is all about teamwork and you will not get far without it! Employers will seek those who will fit in with the culture at work and are actively being positive and sending out positive vibes to everyone around them. This is especially desired in stressful situations.  
                  <br/>  The higher up you want to go, the stronger your EQ is needed. </p>
