               <h2>Neuroplasticity (how to be a smart cookie)</h2>
               <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
               <p>Research shows that knowing about neuroplasticity increases memory functionality. Neuroplasticity is the theory that our brains are malleable, like plastic. This means that we are constantly changing, that our brains are constantly changing by adding new brain cells and strengthening existing ones. This opens up a whole new level of understanding when it comes to learning. If we are exposed to this idea then it means that when we come across a mentally challenging situation then we can approach it with a non-static mindset. Meaning that we can wire our brains to look at the challenge with the thought that “don’t worry, our brain can handle this and grow from it” instead of thinking the opposite, that we are “just not smart enough” to do it. Neuroplasticity is all about “neurons that fire together, wire together” - the more we connect/associate things with each other, the more memory we can evoke using a wider range of stimuli and the stronger those connections become.</p>
               <h3>Discuss how might you engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit.</h3>
               <p> 
                Taking neuroplasticity into our everyday challenges of EDA! Firstly, we are coming across new challenges constantly so having a firm belief in the principal that our brains are malleable is going to make a big impact on how I approach them. </p>
                <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
                <p>Practice associating new learning material to something relevant to connect new neurons to an existing pathway. Also repeating content and topics to fire the neutrons and strengthen the connection.</p>

                <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
                <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
                <p>Growth mindset is quite similar to neuroplasticity and adapts the same idea that our brains are malleable. The brain is like any other muscle in our body, the more we strain it through exercise, the more growth we can achieve over time. This is because a single neuron in our brain cannot handle the stress we put it through alone, it needs friends! 
                   <br/> So, as we strain a single neuron, it will seek for help from other neurons to help push brain power and then eventually our brains will get used to pairing up much faster.  
                    This mindset is paired with its polar opposite and evil twin “the fixed mindset”. A fixed mindset is the idea that talent/skill is given to lucky individuals at birth and it cannot be attained if you weren’t so lucky. I think every human is exposed to both types of mindsets at a young age and really makes its impact as we grow older.<br/> At school, we are graded based on performance and not by effort. For many young kids who aren’t getting ‘good grades’, but are trying really hard, it leads them to believe that they “just aren’t smart enough” which can carry on and become a habitual thought.  
                    Growth mindset is something that needs to be encouraged at an early age so that we can believe that failure is the key to success. We have all heard that quote before, but it has never stuck because we have not been acknowledged at an early age for ‘trying’ and ‘failing’. </p>
                <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
                <p>After going through growth mindset again, it just made me realise how inefficient our schooling system is. If we could adapt more “growth minded” learning then the motivation to learn and do better in school and out of school would increase a lot. </p>
                <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
                <p>I think I’m coming from a heavier side of a fixed mindset and I hope to slowly feel okay to fail and especially not to be scared of failing. </p>
