                <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and
                     your ego as a result of the core learning? </h2>

                <h2>What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming? </h2>
                <p>
                    Values, empathy and self awareness play major roles when it comes to learning with others and programming together. 
                    Having your core values close to our heart allows us to stay true to ourselves especially in stressful situations. 
                    Whether it’s making sure we are still being kind to those next to us or staying fit and healthy while we are working through code, 
                    core values are definitely important. </br>Empathy boosts our ability to learn as a community. 
                    If we see someone struggling with a problem that we have gone through as well then being empathic is like saying, 
                    “Hey, I’ve been done that road before. Let me give you a hand”.  
                    </br>Self-awareness is being able to notice what we are feeling as we are feeling it. If a problem comes up and we are super frustrated,
                     then being self-aware lets us take a step back and say, “Hold on, I’m really annoyed at this problem and maybe 
                     I should take a breather and clear my mind”. 
                </p>

                <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </h2>
                <p>
                    It’s been surprising how effective it has been on my overall approach to learning. In general, I think most of us aren’t personal diary 
                    writers so being given the chance to write and reflect on ourselves in this way is a pretty invigorating feeling.  
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class = "box">

                <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h2>
                <p>
                    Just being comfortable with what I’m writing down. It’s easy to write down what we are thinking and feeling, but then 
                    it’s a whole next step up to be able to show someone else what we wrote.  
                </p>

            <div class = "box">

                <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course? </h2>
                <p>
                    As you guys have mentioned, employability is one of the major reasons, but I think it is also about relieving a bit of tension. For me, coding is 
                    like a huge mountain to climb. There are so many different routes and things to learn and it can be pretty overwhelming especially when you think 
                    about all the other people out there that have mastered the language and know everything from head to toe. It’s easy for me to overthink and stress 
                    out about learning all this code so having core learning come in and give us the chance to think about how we are feeling just makes the journey 
                    less robotic and less daunting, if that makes sense. 
                </p>

            <div class = "box">

                <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer. </h2>
                <p>
                    For me it’s nice to have the space and time to build on myself as I am learning. It really is surprising what you end up learning about yourself when you’re prompted to.

                <h2>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to start my programming career with a job in web development. The opportunity to work remotely is very attractive with my 
                    current lifestyle and would give me some extra time to work on my current relationships with friends/family etc. Long time, 
                    I would like to find my way into A.I development if the life leads me that way.

                <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
                <p>
                    Looking back at my Sprint 2 reflection, I think my strengths are still similar. My ability to quickly cooperate and get stuck into
                    work will come in handy when it comes to the pair programming side of things. I like to get stuck into my work and try not to waste too much
                    time unless I need a break. I pointed out before that one of my limitations was not being confident in my code and thinking it is not good enough
                    for others to see. However, over the remaining course of Foundation, this has improved a lot and I've started to feel more comfortable and capable
                    in coding through problems. One thing I am scared of is just slowing everyone else down.

            <div class ="box">
                <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
                <p>For me, a non-technical challenge is getting used to the pace of Bootcamp and the workload as well. We're being prepared for 9+ hours
                    of coding a day for 9 weeks and it does sound pretty daunting. I hope I can make it through!

                <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
                <p>
                    More self-confidence in social situations, especially in groups. Just being able to openly speak about my ideas and opinions without
                    the feel of being judged in a bad way. I also often find myself trying to overcompensate by making bad jokes so I apologise in advanced.
                </p>   
                <h2>What are expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
                <p> 

                    My expectations for myself is to stay true to myself throughout these 9 weeks and to push my limitations. I want to be able to walk out of 
                    EDA with the feeling that I just achieved something awesome and huge.
                    I’m coming into EDA as a beginner in a web programming and I know that others in the cohort have more experience and knowledge than I do.
                    Naturally, I like to have my own time to work through a problem and see if I can do it by myself. It's when I get to the point of pure
                    frustation is when I feel the need to ask others for help, especially if the answer isn't on Google or isn't explained well there.
