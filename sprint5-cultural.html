                <h2>What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming? </h2>
                <p>
                    Values, empathy and self awareness play major roles when it comes to learning with others and programming together. 
                    Having your core values close to our heart allows us to stay true to ourselves especially in stressful situations. 
                    Whether it’s making sure we are still being kind to those next to us or staying fit and healthy while we are working through code, 
                    core values are definitely important. </br>Empathy boosts our ability to learn as a community. 
                    If we see someone struggling with a problem that we have gone through as well then being empathic is like saying, 
                    “Hey, I’ve been done that road before. Let me give you a hand”.  
                    </br>Self-awareness is being able to notice what we are feeling as we are feeling it. If a problem comes up and we are super frustrated,
                     then being self-aware lets us take a step back and say, “Hold on, I’m really annoyed at this problem and maybe 
                     I should take a breather and clear my mind”.

                <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </h2>
                <p>
                    It’s been surprising how effective it has been on my overall approach to learning. In general, I think most of us aren’t personal diary 
                    writers so being given the chance to write and reflect on ourselves in this way is a pretty invigorating feeling.  
                </p>

            <div class = "box">

                <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h2>
                <p>
                    Just being comfortable with what I’m writing down. It’s easy to write down what we are thinking and feeling, but then 
                    it’s a whole next step up to be able to show someone else what we wrote.

                <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course? </h2>
                <p>
                    As you guys have mentioned, employability is one of the major reasons, but I think it is also about relieving a bit of tension. For me, coding is 
                    like a huge mountain to climb. There are so many different routes and things to learn and it can be pretty overwhelming especially when you think 
                    about all the other people out there that have mastered the language and know everything from head to toe. It’s easy for me to overthink and stress 
                    out about learning all this code so having core learning come in and give us the chance to think about how we are feeling just makes the journey 
                    less robotic and less daunting, if that makes sense.

                <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer. </h2>
                <p>
                    For me it’s nice to have the space and time to build on myself as I am learning. It really is surprising what you end up learning about yourself when you’re prompted to.
