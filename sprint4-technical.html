            <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
            <p> 
                Pseudocode is an awesome tool. It's like a programmer's way of brainstorming what their code is going
                to do. I really enjoy using it, but I am still adapting to the idea of using it. Usually when I am writing
                my code, most of my brainstorming happens in my mind and I go with the "just try something" method which I 
                am going to explain below. </br>
                That being said, Pseudocode would really improve my method of coding. I often get really suck and sometimes
                it takes longer for me to solve the problem because I am tunnel-visioning on whatever code I have written down
                that could be irrelevant.
            </p>

            <h2>Just Try It</h2>
            <p>
                Ah, my current favourite choice. "When in doubt, just try it out" - I think what seperates a good programmer to
                a great programmer is not just in their technical ability, but in their ability to be confident in failing. 
                During my EDA journey, I've come to realise one of my weaknesses is lacking that confidence to write the code
                and watching it throw an error in my face. A thought passes through my head saying "nah this isn't going to work"
                before I even try it. It's a battle I am currently facing and it is hard, but everyone in foundation has been really
                encouraging and helpful.
            </p>

            <h2>Rubber Ducky Method</h2>
            <p>
                This method isn't something I have thought about using a whole lot. You have to describe the problem out to yourself
                as if you were talking to someone else so that you can have a breakthrough in your head and realise the problem wasn't
                that hard to begin with. Even though I don't think about using it, I do it subconsciously when I am really stuck on a 
                problem and trying to think of the next step. What I found is that it doesn't necessarily give me a mental breakthrough on
                how to code my next bit of code, but it helps frame the question of "what am I missing?". Then I can go to google
                and find my answer.
            </p>

            <h2>Error error... error!</h2>
            <p>
                Decoding error messages are quite useful. It helps me see the little things that I have missed from things like
                'undefined' to incorrect initialisers. The benefits really shine through when you couple it with a test. This way
                you get to control what the error will tell you what you're missing and where to look.
            </p>

            <h2>The Bible... I mean Google</h2>
            <p>
                Googling a problem is one of the fastest ways to find the solution. Someone somewhere has definitely run
                into the same problem and has figured it out. This is definitely a 'go-to' when I just don't understand something
                whether it is the concept as a whole or when I am not sure where to start.
            </p>

            <h2>Asking Peers and Coaches for help</h2>
            <p>
                Asking for help directly is one of my last resort methods to finding something out. Generally speaking, a solution
                is probably somewhere in Google and I could type in a question to find the answer in a few seconds instead of asking 
                and then waiting for a response. However, even though I can find the answer, sometimes I just don't understand what it
                means. Anyone can copy and paste and get the answer right, but I find no benefit in doing so because I have no idea
                what the code means. This is when I prefer asking for direct help from everyone in the cohort because I know they will
                help me to understand it the best way that they can.
            </p>

            <h2>Improvement with Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                After all is said and done and the blood, sweat and tears have been poured into the final code... it is time for reflection.
                Reflection is great because it gives me time to go over the parts that I really struggled with and try to commit the knowledge
                I got from it to memory. It's also a great time to grab a coffee and refract!
