            <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
            <p> 
                Pseudocode is an awesome tool. It's like a programmer's way of brainstorming what their code is going
                to do. I really enjoy using it, but I am still adapting to the idea of using it. Usually when I am writing
                my code, most of my brainstorming happens in my mind and I go with the "just try something" method which I 
                am going to explain below. </br>
                That being said, Pseudocode would really improve my method of coding. I often get really suck and sometimes
                it takes longer for me to solve the problem because I am tunnel-visioning on whatever code I have written down
                that could be irrelevant.
            </p>

            <h2>Just Try It</h2>
            <p>
                Ah, my current favourite choice. "When in doubt, just try it out" - I think what seperates a good programmer to
                a great programmer is not just in their technical ability, but in their ability to be confident in failing. 
                During my EDA journey, I've come to realise one of my weaknesses is lacking that confidence to write the code
                and watching it throw an error in my face. A thought passes through my head saying "nah this isn't going to work"
                before I even try it. It's a battle I am currently facing and it is hard, but everyone in foundation has been really
                encouraging and helpful.
