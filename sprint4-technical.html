            <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
            <p> 
                Pseudocode is an awesome tool. It's like a programmer's way of brainstorming what their code is going
                to do. I really enjoy using it, but I am still adapting to the idea of using it. Usually when I am writing
                my code, most of my brainstorming happens in my mind and I go with the "just try something" method which I 
                am going to explain below. </br>
                That being said, Pseudocode would really improve my method of coding. I often get really suck and sometimes
                it takes longer for me to solve the problem because I am tunnel-visioning on whatever code I have written down
                that could be irrelevant.
