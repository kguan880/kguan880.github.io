    <h1>Documenting my personal values</h1>
To me, my personal values are still a long journey of discovery. I believe that they will be continuously evolving as more of life's hardships get thrown my way. I know that at my inexperienced age of 22 going on 23, there is a lot more character that is left to be developed and that will be developed as I see more things.
The core values that are the most important to me are kindness, thoughtfulness, and honesty. A couple of years ago, I was in a toxic relationship... due to the situation, it became very hard to leave as well. But, staying in this relationship went against my values and my friends were also telling me that it was taking a toll on who I was. 
Long story short, I finally had to make the call and end it. A huge wave of relief came over me and I started to feel like myself again, but I had also lost someone who was very close to me for so many years.

I grew up here in NZ and I believe the culture here is very polite and kind by nature. 

One of my strengths (at least I think so) is that once I invest into an idea, project or specific target, I will go the extra mile to get it done and make sure it is as perfect as it could be. This helps me learn a skill and hone it to the best of my ability.
While I like to do things myself at times, I am a team-oriented person and love to teach those around me. I think these two strengths will help me in my journey through bootcamp and in my professional career.

An experience I would like to share is not 'work' specific but does involve collaborating with others. This was back when I was flatting for the first time in Dunedin with a few friends. The job was to set up and manage multiple running accounts to pay for rent, power and internet. It sounded like a simple job to do, but when no one is cooperating, it became a nightmare. It was a struggle of getting everyone to pay one time and calculating the individual costs for power/internet (based on the days you were home or how much power you were using which is hard to measure).
Again, long story short, I had enough of the unproductivity and decided to do it all on my own. This strategy sucked. I managed to get it all up and running, but I couldnt handle doing it every month because it took too much time to do it all and was taxing on my own needed time. Going back, I would just try to get everyone on board, but not take on the responsiblity to do it all.
