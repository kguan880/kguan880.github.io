        <div>
           <p> These three guys confused me at first and it wasn't until we were told to research them that I really understood the difference.
            To help with my explanation, I will be using some screenshots so that my words and references aren't making an even bigger mess in some peoples understanding of them too.
            Without further ado, let's get stuck into it!</p>
            <h3>MARGIN</h3>
            <p>First, let's go over margin. Simplly put, it controls the space FROM the edge of the page to your content. So, let's say you've just started your code and you have a nicely styled title.</p>
            <h2>Figure 1</h2>
            <img class ="figure" src="https://snipboard.io/A8OWf2.jpg">
            
            <p>Now if I add a blue box to my title, can you can see the white space that seperate my title from the edge of the page? This is what margin is.</p>
            <h2>Figure 2</h2>
            <img class="figure" src="https://snipboard.io/SqDfnB.jpg">
            <h3>BORDER</h3>
            <p>Moving on, let's look at border. It is exactly how it sounds which is setting a border around your content space (space that you can define by height and width).
                Looking at the figure below, adding a 30px border will give me something like this. Note: it takes into account the margin and will start from there.
            </p>
            <h2>Figure 3</h2>
            <img class="figure" src="https://snipboard.io/GLi802.jpg">
            <h3>PADDING</h3>
            <p>Last but not least, padding. Padding is similar to margin except now it controls the space from the edges of your border to your content.
                In the figure below, if I add 60px of padding from the top then you can see the big increase in space. Note: you can use padding even if you don't add a border.

            </p>
            <h2>Figure 4</h2>
