            <h2>HTML & CSS Analogy</h2>
            <p>What is HTML and CSS? A great beginner question and one that I will explain here with an analogy.</p>
            <p>I want you to imagine that you are the new head director of EDA marketing team and you are faced with 
                a new challenge of making paper flyers with nothing but words. This means no fonts, colours or images. 
                It'd look pretty boring right? Well HTML is basically what that poster would be, you would be building
                a website with content, but no fonts, colours or images.
                This is where CSS comes in. CSS allows you to add that flair to your paper flyer! Now all of a sudden you 
                have the power to make a sick design and keep your job.
