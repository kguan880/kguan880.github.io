            <h2>HTML & CSS Analogy</h2>
            <p>What is HTML and CSS? A great beginner question and one that I will explain here with an analogy.</p>
            <p>I want you to imagine that you are the new head director of EDA marketing team and you are faced with 
                a new challenge of making paper flyers with nothing but words. This means no fonts, colours or images. 
                It'd look pretty boring right? Well HTML is basically what that poster would be, you would be building
                a website with content, but no fonts, colours or images.
                This is where CSS comes in. CSS allows you to add that flair to your paper flyer! Now all of a sudden you 
                have the power to make a sick design and keep your job.

            <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
            <p>Control flow and loops can be described as three statements : if, for and while.
                Using an everyday example to explain, 'if' statements basically use a specific condition
                before allowing actions to take place. For example let's say I have awoken from my slumber in the morning,
                if it is to the sound of my alarm clock then I will go brush my teeth. If not, then go back to sleep. <br/>
                Does that make sense?
            </p>
            <p>'For' loops are a process used to cycle through arrays and objects usually with some code to do something
                (like add to a count or even use an if statement to check for something). Imagine you've got a weird art project and you need to 
                paint some eggs. For every even number egg, you will paint it blue and for every odd number egg you will paint it green. <br/>
                That's basically for loops in a nutshell (or should I say... eggshell. Sorry)
            </p>
            <p> 'While' loops can be an infinite cycle of doom if you let it. It works just like it sounds, while a condition is still true
                then commit to the action. For example, you're at the gym running the treadmill, burning away last night's guilty pleasure. 
                While the timer is less than 10 minutes, keep running. Simple as that.
