            <h2>HTML & CSS Analogy</h2>
            <p>What is HTML and CSS? A great beginner question and one that I will explain here with an analogy.</p>
            <p>I want you to imagine that you are the new head director of EDA marketing team and you are faced with 
                a new challenge of making paper flyers with nothing but words. This means no fonts, colours or images. 
                It'd look pretty boring right? Well HTML is basically what that poster would be, you would be building
                a website with content and stucture, but no fonts, colours or images.
                This is where CSS comes in. CSS allows you to add that flair to your paper flyer! Now all of a sudden you 
                have the power to make a sick design and keep your job.
            </p>

        <div class ="box">
            <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
            <p>Control flow and loops can be described as three statements : if, for and while.
                Using an everyday example to explain, 'if' statements basically use a specific condition
                before allowing actions to take place. For example let's say I have awoken from my slumber in the morning,
                if it is to the sound of my alarm clock then I will go brush my teeth. If not, then go back to sleep. <br/>
                Does that make sense?
            </p>
            <p>'For' loops are a process used to cycle through arrays and objects usually with some code to do something
                (like add to a count or even use an if statement to check for something). Imagine you've got a weird art project and you need to 
                paint some eggs. For every even number egg, you will paint it blue and for every odd number egg you will paint it green. <br/>
                That's basically for loops in a nutshell (or should I say... eggshell. Sorry)
            </p>
            <p> 'While' loops can be an infinite cycle of doom if you let it. It works just like it sounds, while a condition is still true
                then commit to the action. For example, you're at the gym running the treadmill, burning away last night's guilty pleasure. 
                While the timer is less than 10 minutes, keep running. Simple as that.

            <h2>The DOM</h2>
            <p>Document Object Model (or DOM for short) was confusing for me to understand at first, but much simpler once I got my head around it.
                Okay here goes. So we know HTML is used to put content and structure into our website, right? Going a step deeper into HTML, the code 
                is structured from top to bottom. Like in a poster, you would have the title at the top (most of the time) and then the good stuff
                underneath. Now 'The Dom' is a model that represents what the structure of the HTML file looks like and it actually looks like a big 
                family tree. <br/>
                Cool thing is that anybody with a computer and internet can access the DOM and see what the website is made up of. For a beginner coder like me,
                I like to use this fact and copy awesome looking code for my own projects. And if you wanted, you could look at Google's homepage DOM and change 
                the search button to say something funny (though it wouldn't be made public for everyone else).

            <h2> Accessing Arrays and Objects</h2>
            <p> Both arrays and objects are ways to store data together for ease of access when needed.
                Now, the are both very similar in intention but the situations you might use them are what set them apart.

            </p>
            <p>Arrays are useful when you want to store data in an ordered list (known as elements). Each element is stored with an index (number) based on its position
                in the array. Let's say you're shopping for a big dinner that you're hosting next Sunday and you've written up a shopping list.
                Think of an array like your shopping list and it has things like [beef, spaghetti, milk, eggs] etc. Each product in your list is an element. 
                To access your array, you could say "I want the third thing in my shopping list" and that would come up as milk.
            </p>
            <p>Objects are useful when you need to record characteristics of a person, a place, a building etc. Looking back at your big dinner you have planned,
                you could treat each person coming as an object (just not in real life!). You would record things like their name, location and maybe their dietary requirements.
                Accessing objects are different to arrays because instead of thinking of the number in the list, you just think about the key (characteristic) like diet and check if 
            they are vegetarian or vegan. </p>

        <div class = "box">
            <h2> Functions</h2>
            <p>Functions are set lines of codes ready for you to use. The benefit of functions is that if you think you need to use that same set of code more than once then you
                can create a function that stores them and runs it on command. A very simple example would be like locking and unlocking your door. You need to put your key in the door, turn it and take the key out.
                A function is like putting a button on your key so that when you press it, it will do all of the steps without you having to do it again.
